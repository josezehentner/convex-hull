# Convex Hull Algorithms
This project contains an implementation of the Quickhull and the Andrew Convex Hull algorithms written in C++.
For visualization the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) framework is used.

## Requirements
1. C++ 20 compiler
2. CMake version 4.0
3. [SFML 3](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/3.0.2/)

## Build the Application
### Windows
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Open the generated Visual Studio solution in the build folder and build the ALL target.

### Linux and macOS
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run the Application
### Windows
In the build folder, run the produced `convex_hull.exe`

### Linux and macOS
```bash
./convex_hull
```

## Executing Tests
Tests are built automatically using GoogleTest.
From the build folder, run:
```bash
ctest
```
